        <p>My name is Nathaniel Anderson. I live out in the foothils of Berthoud Colorado with my wife and son. We have some livestock and an old dog who helps with the kid and goats. I like my life simple, and my work challenging, I learn fast and I work well with a team.</p>
        <p>Please take time to look over my complete portfolio for examples of my work. Anything found lacking can be taught, I will rise to any challenge needed and I will meet all standards required of me. Thanks for taking a look!</p>
